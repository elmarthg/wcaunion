          <p class="section-intro">
            Weingart Workers Union is made up of frontline and support staff at Weingart Center who are
            coming together to build real power on the job. Our goal is simple: better conditions for workers,
            better care for residents.

            <p class="card-body">
              We are case managers, housing navigators, residential aides, coordinators, QA staff, kitchen and
              facilities workers, and other Weingart employees from across programs and shifts. Every day we
              support people experiencing homelessness and housing instability, often under difficult and
              emotionally heavy conditions.

            <p class="card-body">
              Staffing levels, caseloads, pay, safety policies, and constant changes all affect our ability to
              show up for residents. On our own, it’s easy to be ignored. As a union, we can sit down with
              management as equals to negotiate clear, enforceable standards around pay, workload, safety,
              training, and respect on the job.

            <p class="card-body">
              Our union is democratic and member-led. Workers decide:
            </p>
            <ul class="card-body">
              <li>Who serves on the organizing and bargaining committees.</li>
              <li>Which issues are top priorities in negotiations.</li>
              <li>Whether to approve or reject any proposed contract.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="card-body">
              No contract goes into effect unless a majority of union members vote to approve it.

            <h2 class="card-title">What this means for residents</h2>
            <p class="card-body">
              When staff have fair pay, reasonable workloads, and a voice in decisions, turnover goes down and
              stability goes up. Residents benefit from experienced, supported teams who can build trust and
              provide consistent care over time. A strong union is part of building a stronger Weingart for the
              people we serve.

            Weingart Workers Union is organizing with the Office and Professional Employees International Union
            (OPEIU) Local 30. OPEIU provides experience, resources, and support, while decisions about our
            workplace are made by Weingart workers themselves.

              OPEIU is a resource and support structure, not a replacement for Weingart workers’ voices.
              Weingart employees decide:
            </p>
            <ul class="card-body">
              <li>Whether to unionize.</li>
              <li>What priorities to bring to the bargaining table.</li>
              <li>Who represents them in negotiations.</li>
              <li>Whether to ratify any proposed contract.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="card-body">
              OPEIU Local 30’s job is to back up those decisions with experience, legal protections, and
              organizing strength.
