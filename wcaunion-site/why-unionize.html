          <h1 class="section-title">Why Weingart workers are organizing</h1>
          <p class="section-intro">
            A union is us—coworkers—coming together to negotiate improvements in staffing, pay, safety,
            training, and fair policies. It’s a legal, structured way to make our jobs safer and more
            sustainable and to make sure residents receive consistent, dignified care.
          </p>

            <h2 class="card-title">Safer staffing &amp; workloads</h2>
            <p class="card-body">
              Workers know when caseloads or staff ratios are unsafe and unsustainable.
              A union contract can set enforceable standards around staffing, overtime, and workload so
              residents receive the support they deserve and staff aren’t burned out.

            <h2 class="card-title">Fair pay &amp; benefits</h2>
            <p class="card-body">
              Through collective bargaining, workers can push for raises, consistent differentials,
              clearer pay steps, and benefits that reflect the difficulty and importance of the work we do.

            <h2 class="card-title">Respect and a real voice</h2>
            <p class="card-body">
              A union gives workers a structured way to address issues like favoritism,
              discipline, scheduling, and policy changes—with representation and due process.

            <h2 class="card-title">Better care for residents</h2>
            <p class="card-body">
              Stable jobs and fair treatment keep experienced staff in the building,
              which means more consistent relationships and better outcomes for residents.

            <h2 class="card-title">Training and support</h2>
            <p class="card-body">
              Workers can bargain for meaningful training on de-escalation, harm reduction,
              documentation, and other tools needed to do the job safely and well.

              Workers at shelters, supportive housing sites, and social service agencies across the country
              are unionizing, winning improvements, and building power together.
              We are part of that movement.
